# DAT505-Submission
My project comes from a story about a Chinese girl, so she rode a chicken symbolizing the map of China.
Because in legend, the map of China is a rooster.

In the process of learning Threejs, I have a deeper understanding of Javascript.

In my project, the focus is on the import and control of animations.
Keypress is used to control the direction of motion of the animation so that it can rotate and walk 360 degrees freely.

This will be the basis for my future 3D games.
